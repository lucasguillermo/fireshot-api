# Introduction #

FireShot is a Firefox extension that creates screenshots of web pages (entirely or just visible part).

# Details #

The plugin provides a set of editing and annotation tools, which let users quickly modify web captures and insert text annotations and graphical annotations. Such functionality will be especially useful for web designers, testers and content reviewers.

The captures can be:

  * uploaded to FREE public screenshot hosting
  * saved to disk (PNG, GIF, JPEG, BMP, PDF)
  * printed
  * copied to clipboard
  * e-mailed
  * sent to configurable external editor for further processing.
