This API provides FireShot automation.

FireShot is a free Firefox extension (working only for Windows users) that creates screenshots of web pages (entirely or just visible part).

By using this API and Javascript, you can embed web page capturing functions into your website. For example, this can be a button or event, that launches FireShot and opens the editor with the captured web page. You can think of other ways of using FireShot:

**saving screenshots to disk**uploading to web
**copying to clipboard**e-mailing
**exporting to 3rd-party editor**printing

The embedding is quick and simple.
